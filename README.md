# FootTraffic 
## (in progress)

* Google Nest Cameras trigger a motion detection event (using the Google developer API)
* Images from the event are captured and retrieved
* These images are processed using AWS Recognition in a serverless Lambda function (accessed through AWS API Gateway)
* Resulting image labels are then emailed to the user with an attached image from the event

Code is continuously built and deployed to Lambda instances using AWS CodePipeline




## TODO
* Note: samTemplate.yaml is missing (contains env vars)
* gateway setup
